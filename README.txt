Compile all the sources in src/main/java/sources.txt using javac @sources.txt
from the src/main/java directory. Then run java assesment.assesment from the
src/main/java directory.

Can't do that?
Right - compile:
src/main/java/drawing/Canvas.java
src/main/java/geometry/CartesianCoordinate.java
src/main/java/geometry/LineSegment.java
src/main/java/scene/scene.java
src/main/java/scene/obstacle.java
src/main/java/scene/flock.java
src/main/java/scene/scene_object.java
src/main/java/animals/animal.java
src/main/java/animals/flockingBird.java
src/main/java/assesment/assesment.java

The entry point is the assesment class.

Or you can open this directory with Netbeans.
